* IDE of your choice. We will be using Visual Studio Code
    * https://code.visualstudio.com/
* Android Phone with Chrome or Firefox installed


## Running the server

Open up a terminal and run `npm install` to install the required dependencies. This only needs to be done once.

```bash
npm install
```

Then type the following to run the server.

```bash
npm run start
```

Application will be served in `http://localhost:5000`.

If you're using your Android Phone to connect, replace `localhost` with your actual IP:

`http://192.168.x.x:5000/`

You may have to allow port `5000` from your development machine for the phone to connect.
